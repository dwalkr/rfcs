# Tina Server

## Summary

1. Create a `tina-server` package that runs a node HTTP server in a development environment that uses Tina
2. Plugins such as `@tinacms/api-git` can hook in to this server to add API endpoints or manipulate request data
3. `tina-server` can run standalone or hook into Gatsby's dev server

## Motivation

### Tina Teams Integration
We want to be able to pass user identity information into Tina's git backend from Tina Teams. 
However, we don't want to bake this proprietary integration into the open-source git backend.

### Additional Backends
Integrations such as Tina Teams should also be available to other backends. 
To do this without duplicating code necessitates a highler-level abstraction to host multiple backend plugins.

This is also an opportunity to better establish rules and conventions for creating a backend integration for Tina.
